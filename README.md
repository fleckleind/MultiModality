# MultiModality


## Zero-Shot
The definition of zero-shot task is as follow:
> A type of machine learning task in which a model is required to make predictions or perform actions on classes, tasks, or inputs that it has never seen during training.

In the context of natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision, a model is considered to be performing a zero-shot task when it is applied to new tasks or categories by leveraging pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning, often guided by natural language prompts or semantic descriptions.
