# BLIP-3
[xGen-MM (BLIP-3): A Family of Open Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08872?)

BLIP-3: introduce a safety-tuned model with DPO, replace Q-Former layers with more scalable vision token sampler, and simplify the training process via the unification of the training objectives to a single loss at every training stage, aiming to mitigate harmful behaviors such as hallucinations and improve safety.
